# Arguments requiring file values, such as --licenseKeyFile, will need to have
# their values adjusted to be used in the server profile. Files such as
# the license key file and any password files can be added to
# the profile's misc-files directory, and then removed after they have
# been used. For example, if the PingDirectory.lic file is placed in the
# misc-files directory, it can be referred to in setup-arguments.txt using
# '--licenseKeyFile ${PING_PROFILE_ROOT}/misc-files/PingDirectory.lic'
